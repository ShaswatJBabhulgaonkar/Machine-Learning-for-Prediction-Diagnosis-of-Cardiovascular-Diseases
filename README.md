# Machine-Learning-for-Prediction-and-Diagnosis-of-Cardiovascular-Diseases
Abstract
Diagnosis and Prediction of cardiovascular diseases has often become a challenge faced by doctors and hospitals in India as well as abroad. Despite major transformations in lifestyles of people and advancements in medical domain; heart attacks still hold a major share in the global death rate. The ambiguity in diagnosis of most heart diseases lies in the intricate grouping of clinical and pathological data which may introduce misinterpretation of data among clinical experts, doctors and researchers. Ultimately,the problem lies within making decisions concerned with predicting and later diagnosing the heartdiseases. These decisions can have adrastic effect on life of a person. The proposed approach to use machine learning for prediction as well as diagnostic purposes can play a very important role in this area. Various Machine Learning techniques can be used for classifying healthy people from the ones suffering from heart diseases. This work intends to presents a comprehensive review of prediction of Cardiac diseases by using Machine Learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, K-nearest neighbour, Naive Bayes and Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network. The work also proposes a classiﬁer (Ensemble Classiﬁer) which takes into consideration the decision of all individual classiﬁers for better prediction results.
